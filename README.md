## Keyboard Shortcuts

This extension provides the following default keyboard shortcuts:

- `Ctrl+Alt+I` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Alt+I` (Mac): Run the import sorter command.

### Customizing Shortcuts

You can customize the keyboard shortcuts by modifying the keybindings in your **keybindings.json** file.

1. Go to **File > Preferences > Keyboard Shortcuts** or press `Ctrl+K Ctrl+S`.
2. Search for `linelength-import-sorter.sortImports`.
3. Right-click the command and select **Change Keybinding**.
4. Enter your preferred key combination.

Alternatively, you can edit the **keybindings.json** file directly:

```json
{
    "key": "Ctrl+Shift+I",
    "command": "linelength-import-sorter.sortImports",
    "when": "editorTextFocus"
}
```

## Coming Soon
- Sort in order of descending line length
- Sort blocks with commented imports
- Sort within a selected chunk of text
- Support for Javacript
- Support for Arial and Helvetica fonts (coming not so soon because who even codes in arial or helvetica? :) 


## Supported Fonts and Languages

Currently only works with python (üêç`.py` files) and <span style = "font-family: courier new;">monospace</span> fonts

## Known Issues
The imports are being recognized by string manipulation for now, so if your file has several lines in a row that start with `from` or `import`, they will be sorted. This happens only when the lines start with `from` or `import` with no other characters (except spaces) preceding them. If your lines start with "from or 'import, they will be fine and won't be sorted.
